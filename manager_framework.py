Longer Term Plans:
    1. Define Transformation Categories
        First, categorize the transforms based on their characteristics
    2. Features of the Transform Manager:
        Registration System: Allow transforms to be registered with the manager along with metadata about their category and any constraints on their use.
        Sampling Logic: Implement logic to sample from these transforms based on their probabilities and constraints.
            This could involve conditional probabilities if the selection of one transform affects the likelihood of selecting another.
        Sequence Validation: After sampling transforms, validate the sequence to ensure it doesn't violate any specified rules 
            (e.g., certain geometric transforms shouldn't follow others).
    3. Customize Transform Classes or Functions
        For each transform, whether a standard one from torchvision or a custom one you've developed, ensure they can be instantiated
            or called with a consistent interface. This may involve wrapping functions in classes or ensuring your custom transforms inherit from a common base class.
    4. Use Metadata for Advanced Logic
        For complex logic, such as disallowing certain sequences or adjusting probabilities dynamically, use metadata associated with each transform.
            This metadata could include flags for mutability (whether a transform affects subsequent transforms' applicability) or tags for more nuanced categorization.
    5. Testing and Iteration
        With a system this complex, it's crucial to test extensively. This includes unit tests for individual transforms and integration tests
            for the transform manager logic. Be prepared to iterate on the design as you discover new requirements or as the limitations of your initial approach become clear.
